- The purpose of this program is to provide transparency to students on where they stand at any point in time in terms of their GPA.
- All the calculations included in this program are based on the Rithvik's school board process and is reusable for other school boards. 


## Technologies Used
- Java SE, Version 17


## Features
List the ready features here:

## Project Status
Project is: _complete_


## Room for Improvement

Room for improvement:
- User friendly messages

To do:
- Provide option to input target GPA to see various grades/credits that a student should get in their courses.
- Provide option to edit grades/credits for individual courses to recalculate GPA values


## Acknowledgements

- I was inspired to do this project as the school website was not able to show my projected GPAs at any point in time. In our school district, we get frequent tests in class and as grades/credits starts to come, it makes me curious to see how these grades/credits influence my cumulative GPAs. Hence I did this program. This code is reusable with minimal changes for other school districts.
